This repository contains all my **2nd year CSE assignments** for the **Data Structures & Algorithms** course, implemented in **C**.  
It serves as both a learning archive and a showcase of my problem-solving journey.

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run

Each program is written in **C** and can be compiled using `gcc` or any C compiler.

```bash
# Example: Compile a solution
gcc p01.c -o p01

# Run the program
./p01
```
